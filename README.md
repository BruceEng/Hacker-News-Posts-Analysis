# Hacker-News-Posts-Analysis
[Click here to see the Jupyter Notebook](Hacker+News+Project+IIC2.ipynb)

This project analysis focuses on determining best time to post questions that yield highest volume of responses.

Hacker News (sometimes abbreviated as HN) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. Hacker News was started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

This project is limited to question type posts and comparing the average number of comments/responses to questions within each hour of a day. The purpose in doing this is to determine if the data analysis results will provide best time of day to post questions where I would expect the highest frequency of comments/responses.

I chose to dig a lot deeper than what the project guidelines suggested. As a result I discovered some very interesting results and came up with much different conclusions than the guided project results.
